# Leadoff Events (WIP - working on separating data by date rather than just using raw season counts)

The files in this folder contain data pertaining to different leadoff event counts (LEC) for teams (tlec) and pitchers (lec). Statistics include leadoff batting average against, OBP against, OPS and wOBA against, strikeout percent, walk percent, and others.

The first link below will take you to the team stats Tableau visualization page, and the second link will take you to the individual player page.
