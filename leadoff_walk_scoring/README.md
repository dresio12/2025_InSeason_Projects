# Basic Leadoff Walk Analysis - A multitude of visualizations assessing team performance after issuing leadoff walks. 

The dated folders include the chart types listed below:

WalksvRuns - Shows the relationship between the total number of leadoff walks issued and the total amount of runs scored in those innings in which a leadoff walk was issued

InningsOneRunScored - Shows the relationship between the total number of leadoff walks issued and the number of innings in which one run scored after the leadoff walk

RunScorePct - A column graph that takes the previous chart and displays the percentage of innings in which at least one run scores after a leadoff walk, from highest to lowest

LOWPct - Percentage of total innings that begin with a leadoff walk


The time_series folder includes the files used to generate the tableau visualizations seen here (downloading the file will show the other visualizations): https://public.tableau.com/views/LeadoffWalkTimeSeries/PercentageofInningsaRunScoresAfteraLeadoffWalkOverTime?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link
